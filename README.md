# Deep_Learning

This repository records some notes, including math derivation and code implementation, of Nerual Network. The notes are made based on the "Nerual Networks and Deep Learning" class on Coursera
by professor Andrew Ng and some of notes from cs231n at Stanford.

Since this derivation is made on my own, there might be bugs or errors here or there. If you have found any, don't hesitate to reach out to me and give me a chance to fix it!
Enjoy reading!
