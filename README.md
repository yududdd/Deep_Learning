# Deep_Learning

This repository records some notes, including math derivation and code implementation, of Nerual Network and following materials.
The notes are made based on the Deep learning specialization classes on Coursera by professor Andrew Ng and some of notes from cs231n at Stanford.

**Note** Please be aware this notebook only provides a <b>basic</b> understanding of NN and deep learning.

Finally, there might be bugs or errors here or there. If you have found any, don't hesitate to reach out to me!
Enjoy reading!
